Zinc also acts as a neurotransmitter, signaling changes in neurons in response to the immune system and triggers the activation and function of immune cells and inflammatory responses in the body, maintaining hemostasis of the immune system.</p> <p><strong style=""font-size: 0.875rem;"" data-mce-style=""font-size: 0.875rem;"">SKIN HEALTH: </strong>Zinc is present in the dermis and epidermis region of the skin and plays an important role in regulating skin health. Zinc works on acne, eczema, and dermatitis by activation of the anti-microbial response of the body. Zinc inhibits tyrosinase enzymes, reducing the levels of melanocytes and pigmentation on the skin. Zinc also enhances follicular growth on the scalp, promoting hair growth and reduction of hair fall.</p> <p><strong style=""font-size: 0.875rem;"" data-mce-style=""font-size: 0.875rem;"">WOUND HEALING: </strong>Zinc is an essential trace element exhibiting critical physiologic, enzymatic, and structural functions in wound healing. Zinc regulates thrombotic factors in the platelets that are crucial for blood clotting at the wound site. In the inflammation stage, zinc mediates neutrophils and macrophages to reduce bacterial inflammation. In the recovery stage, zinc is required for the proliferation of fibroblast for collagen production and skin maintenance.</p> <p><strong style=""font-size: 0.875rem;"" data-mce-style=""font-size: 0.875rem;"">REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH: </strong>Zinc plays important role in maintaining reproductive health in women and men.
